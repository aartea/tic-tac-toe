#Tic-Tac-Toe
Second project deliverable of ADI course (end of week 3). This is a simple program that generates a game of tic-tac-toe to be utilised by two human players. 


**This is an edit to the master-branch version. This is an attempt at remodifying the code to present a stripped down version of tic-tac-toe.
